"""Custom-operator mutation driver (universalmutator + comby) for the salt crate.

This is the engine for *custom operator packs* — the domain-specific complement
to cargo-mutants. Each pack lives under `mutants/operators/<name>/` with a
`manifest.toml` (see that dir for the schema). The engine is pack-agnostic: it
runs whatever packs exist and feeds their results to the SAME shared gate that
cargo-mutants uses (`scripts/mutation_gate.py`), via the
caught/missed/timeout/unviable file contract (the `_adapt` step maps a mutant to
its stable id).

It uses universalmutator's `mutate` to GENERATE mutants but runs and classifies
them itself (`analyze`): a clean baseline is required first, `#[cfg(test)]` code
is excluded, and timeouts are reported separately rather than counted as caught.

Subcommands:

  plan [--diff <base>] [--packs a,b]
        Generate rules, resolve target files, generate the mutants, and print
        what WOULD be tested (counts + each mutant's stable id). Runs no tests
        and does not touch the working tree's tracked files. Use this to review
        operators before a real run.

  run  [--diff <base>] [--packs a,b] --output <dir>
        Full pipeline: generate -> mutate -> analyze (run the test command per
        mutant) -> write caught.txt/missed.txt/unviable.txt/timeout.txt into
        <dir>, ready for `mutation_gate.py report --results <dir>`.

In `--diff <base>` mode only files AND lines changed vs <base> are mutated
(the PR-gate scope); without it, every gate site in the crate is mutated.
